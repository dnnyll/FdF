   - **Sub-steps**:
     - Open and read the file (using functions like `open`, `read`).
     - Parse the file line by line to extract height and width.
     - Store the parsed data in a suitable data structure (e.g., a 2D array).

---

### 4. **Set Up the Rendering Loop**
   - **Sub-steps**:
     - Initialize a rendering window using `mlx_new_window`.
     - Set up the main loop to handle rendering (`mlx_loop`).
     - Create a function to handle redrawing the window each frame.

---

### 5. **Convert Map Data to Coordinates**
   - **Sub-steps**:
     - Convert the 2D array of height values into 3D coordinates.
     - Consider the scaling and positioning of the map on the window.
     - Apply transformations for isometric or parallel projection.

---

### 6. **Draw the Wireframe**
   - **Sub-steps**:
     - Implement line drawing using Bresenham's algorithm or a similar method.
     - Draw lines between points to form the wireframe.
     - Ensure proper scaling and perspective.

---

### 7. **Handle User Inputs**
   - **Sub-steps**:
     - Capture keyboard and mouse events using `mlx_key_hook` and `mlx_mouse_hook`.
     - Implement basic controls like zoom, pan, and rotate.
     - Provide feedback to ensure user interactions are reflected.

---

### 8. **Add Visual Enhancements**
   - **Sub-steps**:
     - Implement color gradients based on height values.
     - Add smooth transitions or shading effects.
     - Handle edge cases, such as negative heights or large maps.

---

### 9. **Debug and Optimize**
   - **Sub-steps**:
     - Test with different map files, check for performance issues.
     - Optimize the drawing loop to handle larger maps smoothly.
     - Use debugging tools or print statements to trace issues.

---

### 10. **Final Touches and Documentation**
   - **Sub-steps**:
     - Ensure code is clean and well-documented.
     - Write a README file explaining how to use your program.
     - Test thoroughly before final submission.

**Step 1: Understanding the Requirements** and identify the **key features** of the FDF project. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

### 1. **Reading Map Files**
   - **Purpose**: The program needs to read and interpret data from map files, which typically contain height values arranged in a grid.
   - **Details**:
     - Each line in the file represents a row of the grid.
     - Each number in the line represents the height at that grid point.
     - The file format is plain text, with rows separated by newlines and values separated by spaces.

### 2. **Storing Map Data**
   - **Purpose**: After reading the file, the data needs to be stored in a structured way for easy access during rendering.
   - **Details**:
     - Use a 2D array or similar data structure to store the grid of height values.
     - This structure will allow you to map each (x, y) coordinate to its corresponding height value.

### 3. **Rendering the Wireframe**
   - **Purpose**: Visualize the map as a wireframe model in a window.
   - **Details**:
     - Convert the 2D height map into a 3D coordinate system.
     - Use basic 3D-to-2D projection (like isometric projection) to render the wireframe on a 2D screen.
     - Draw lines between neighboring points to form the wireframe.

### 4. **Implementing User Interaction**
   - **Purpose**: Allow users to interact with the model (e.g., rotate, zoom, pan).
   - **Details**:
     - **Keyboard Controls**: For actions like rotating or translating the view.
     - **Mouse Controls**: For zooming or rotating, enhancing the interactive experience.
     - Consider using key and mouse hooks provided by `minilibX`.

### 5. **Applying Transformations**
   - **Purpose**: Apply transformations to the model for better visualization.
   - **Details**:
     - **Scaling**: Adjust the size of the model to fit the window.
     - **Translation**: Move the model to center it or adjust its position.
     - **Rotation**: Rotate the model around different axes to view it from various angles.
     - These transformations allow dynamic adjustments for better exploration of the map.

### 6. **Enhancing Visuals**
   - **Purpose**: Improve the visual appeal and clarity of the wireframe.
   - **Details**:
     - Use color gradients or shading to differentiate heights.
     - Add features like background color or grid lines for better visual separation.
     - Optional: Add a UI or text overlays for additional information (e.g., current zoom level, rotation angle).

### 7. **Handling Edge Cases**
   - **Purpose**: Ensure the program handles all possible inputs gracefully.
   - **Details**:
     - Handle large maps by optimizing memory and rendering performance.
     - Ensure proper handling of maps with extreme height values (both positive and negative).
     - Manage incorrect or corrupted files by providing error messages and safe exits.

### 8. **Optimizing Performance**
   - **Purpose**: Ensure smooth operation, especially with larger maps.
   - **Details**:
     - Optimize the rendering loop to maintain a good frame rate.
     - Efficiently handle user input without lag.
     - Consider performance during transformations and line drawing.
